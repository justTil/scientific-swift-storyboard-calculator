# This is the documentation and short explanation for the calculator V 0.3

## UI Explanation
Right down below, you can see the calculator in portrait mode with different button colors and designs.
Buttons with green text or button color already work and are integrated into the code. 
**The buttons with red text are currently not connected to any function**, and pressing them can lead to the app crashing.
### Horizontal and Portrait mode:
You can simply change between the differen modes by pressing the rotate button at the right top corner in the simulator.

## Contact
The calculator is still in early development and will receive updates in the future. 
If you find bugs or have ideas on how to improve the code, please conctact me at: **til-schwarze@myotech.berlin**

## Known bugs: 
- Writing e.g. 5(3+2) will cause a crash. Instead, you have to add the 'asterisk' symbol beforehand, like that: 5*(3+2) 
- Typing in a chain of symbols like 7.0))))) and pressing the equal button will result in a crash
- While typing 5**2 into the calculator works, 5//3 will crash the app

*Thank you for reading the documentation, and I hope that the provided code will proof itself useful.*
