Hi,
this is a short documentation for the calculator.

Right down below, you may see the calculator in portrait mode with different button colors and designs.
Buttons with green text, for example the number buttons, are working and are already integrated into the code. 
Same goes with the operators, the clear button, +/- and %.
The buttons with red text are currently not connected to any function, however I did experience that the app may crashe when the buttons are tapped. 

Horizontal and Portrait mode:
You can simply change between the differen modes, while the simulator is running and you'll see the different views.

The calculator is still in early development and will receive updates in the future. 
If you find bugs or have ideas on how to improve the code, please conctact me at: til-schwarze@myotech.berlin

I hope this helps you out,
